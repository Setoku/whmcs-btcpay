## Troubleshooting

0. Ensure a valid SSL certificate is installed on your server. Also ensure your root CA cert is updated. If your CA cert is not current, you will see curl SSL verification errors.
1. Verify that your web server is not blocking POSTs from servers it may not recognize. Double check this on your firewall as well, if one is being used.
2. Check the version of this plugin against the official plugin repository to ensure you are using the latest version. Your issue might have been addressed in a newer version! See the [Releases](https://github.com/btcpayserver/whmcs-plugin/releases/latest) page for the latest.
3. If all else fails, contact us using one of the methods described in the Support section above.

**TIP**: When contacting support it will help us is you provide:

* WHMCS and BTCPay Server Plugin Version
* Any log files that will help
  * WHMCS logs and Web server error logs
* Screen grabs of error message if applicable.
